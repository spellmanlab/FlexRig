FlexRig is an open-source platform for head-fixed mouse behavior. Originally designed to run an attentional set-shifting task, it can be used for a wide range of water reward-based tasks involving auditory, whisker somatosensory, and/or olfactory stimuli.

To start using FlexRig:
1. Download the repository
2. Gather the components from the parts list. This includes url-links to commercially available items, 3D-printable .stl files, CNC-machinable files, and printable PCB board design 
4. Assemble the rig, following the illustrated assembly guide
5. Install the Arduino function library
